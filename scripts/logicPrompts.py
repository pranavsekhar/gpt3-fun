Then I spot some more fans, stan hella hardcore (Can I have a picture?)
Asking for a pic and I say sure
Scratch my dick and shake his hand
Shaking uncontrollably, he tells me I'm the man
Now I'm headed to aisle three for some Bounty paper towels
I also grab some wet wipes to clean the shit from my bowels
A really hot girl walks by with a fat ass
But I'm just wondering if Hefty really holds the most trash

I'm marvelous, I'm all of this
That's why your girl all on my dick
I make 'em cum, boy, you make 'em sick
My net worth get the bank grossed out
No I.D. up on the beat, but 6ix, he kill it, no doubt
This a revelation, memories when I drive the M5 or the bus station
I have evolved, you's a motherfuckin' crustacean
What more can I say? Run it back and they hit replay
Bobby Boy Records, yeah, we celebratin' all day

You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams, I know I'mma do it, get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money, don't make me mention
That it'll cost you nothin' but time for you to pay attention

Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5
You know this that shit that you bumpin'
In your whip while you drive
I've been living life and I hope that you do the same
Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game
'Bout time that they know my name

Fuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside
I wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride
Reflecting on memories from my childhood
Bringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good
All I ever gave a fuck about was my career
But all that shit out the window now that my son is here
Fuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams
Fuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less
If it ain't 'bout my happiness, than I could give a fuck less

I've been battlin' with my demons
I'm cowardice when I see 'em
I'm powerless, I can't beat 'em
But deep down, I feel like I need 'em
Power is freedom, you can lead 'em but can't feed 'em
Smilin' on my face but I'm dyin' under the surface
What is my purpose? I'm feelin' worthless
Tell me what worth is
My flaws, I happily greet 'em
Imperfections, I love 'em
My enemies, I defeat 'em
Man, I know somebody gon' relate to this
To keeping it real, it's insane, you better pray for this
'Cause I wanted this shit all my life
'Til I finally got it and realized there's so much more to life
Used to dream I'd become the fuckin' man I am
Stackin' money and readin' my son Sam I Am
Love life, can't tell you how much a fan I am

amenText = '''
This right here for anyone who ride with me
Heard me laugh, watch me cry, did time with me
In the game, not just on the sideline with me
I'm a sinner, I'll admit it, but I got God with me
Been to Hell and back twice just to feel the burn
If your ass don't fall down then you'll never learn
I just wanna be the best that I can be
I just wanna be me, even if it sound naive
I thought acceptance from others it would set me free
But it didn't, no
Oh, no, it never did
No matter what I say, no matter what I give
Sometimes people make me question if I wanna live
We call that a dark day, such a dark day
But I know tomorrow gon' come, it gon' come my way
And I know in my heart it's going to be a better day, it's gon' be a better day
That's why I came here to say
