The following is a comedy skit between Jared, the supervillain, and Caleb, the superhero. Caleb is about to catch Jared with evidence of his crimes.
(Skit starts)
Caleb: Oh, so you're the legendary thief that everybody's tried so hard to catch. 

Jared: Who's asking? 

Caleb: ... another question. Okay. First off. Why do y'all do that? "Who's asking," what do you expect me to say to that? You're just giving yourself away and, and I, and what do I say? What do I say after that? Stupid. Like at least try to like, act like you don't know English or something. Be more creative, like, "Oh, sorry. I don't, I don't speak"... nevermind. I'm getting off topic. To answer your question. I'm the guy that's going to catch you. 

Jared: Oh, really? With what evidence? 

Caleb: Oh, there's plenty of evidence. Like what's in the hoodie pocket?

Jared: What? This bottle? Why would a simple water bottle incriminate me?

Caleb: Shake it.

Jared: You're smarter than you look.

Caleb: That line doesnt work here. But anyways, I have reason to believe that you tried to steal a key to a safe that held millions upon millions of dollars. However, I swapped that key with a banana before you got to it.

Jared: Impressive. But I only expected that.

Caleb: ...Really? 

Jared: Yes, really. I expected you to swap that out with this banana. So I managed to steal the key BEFORE I stole it. And implanted it into the banana that you would swap it with. The one that you have is a fake replica key that I made.

Caleb: Funny that you should say that. Because I knew you would make a fake key. So I STOLE the fake key that YOU made, and swapped it with the real one. So that when you would inevitably swap the real one with the fake one, you would actually put the real one back in its place. In other words, the one in that banana, is a fake one.

Jared: Hm. Very clever, but I thought ahead. I planted bombs around the city that I could detonate at any moment in several locations, if you don't give me the key right now. Now, what will it be? The key or destruction?

Caleb: It's a hard decision. It's a good thing I don't have to pick because this is the battery to your detonator. 

Jared: I'd be angry, if I didn't already put the bombs on a backup timer, 

Caleb: I'd be pressed, if we didn't already disarm them.

Jared: I'd be upset if I didn't....

*Caleb's phone rings*

Jared: You might want to answer that.

Caleb: Hello?

Assistant (over the phone): Yeah, I'm calling back this number because your dry cleaning's ready--ahhhh! Owwww! Ouuugh!

*There are explosion sounds on the other side of the phone call.*

Jared: I knew you would disarm the bombs. That's why I placed EXTRA bombs at YOUR dry cleaner. You'll never enjoy unwrinkled clothes again. You'll have to iron them, like EVERYONE else!

Caleb: That sucks. Because we relocated those bombs... to YOUR dry cleaners!

Jared: I think you missed one detail.

Caleb: Hm. Not likely. You're caught, bro.

Jared: I'm not even here. 

Caleb: What...WHAT!?

Jared: I was NEVER there. You've been FaceTiming me this entire time!

Caleb: Now hold on--WHAT!?

Jared: This entire time! I'm actually in my house, CHILLING! You thought you was a step ahead the whole time? Nope! You weren't even talking to me. I've been CHILLING. I was CHILL! Good luck! Good luck trying to find me!

Caleb: What do I need luck for? I don't need a thing!

Jared: Hahaha. What do you mean?

Caleb: I'm in YOUR HOUSE!

Jared (shocked): What...that's not true!

*Caleb is indeed at Jared's house, and knocks on Jared's door*

Jared: What... 

Caleb: OPEN UP.

Jared: What...how did you find me?

Caleb: OPEN UP. The door.

Jared: Yo, how did you find me? How...

(Skit ends)

This is a comedy skit between Caleb and Jared, two roommates. They hear an intruder in their house.
(Skit starts)

Caleb: Bro, there's an intruder in our house!

Jared: Oh, let's go get them. First I'll quick save.

*Jared quick saves*

Caleb: What was that?

Jared: Oh, nothing. Aight, let's go!

Caleb goes out to face the intruder, thinking Jared is coming with him. In reality, Jared stays behind and listens as Caleb gets viciously beat to a pulp.

Jared then reloads his save, going back in time to his earlier save.

Caleb: What was that? ... Wait, what? What just happened? Did we travel back in time?

Jared: Yeah bro I quick saved, and reloaded my save. We're back at where we were earlier in the skit. So who is the guy? What's he got? Let's go get him!
