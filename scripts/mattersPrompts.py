- Live by yourself for a week and see what you learn about yourself. Staying in my dorm during Spring Break sounds lame but I’m very happy I did it both times. When was the last time you were truly bored, didn’t have stimulation, and nobody was nearby?
- If you haven’t before, work a Service job for perhaps a month (especially if you’re on track to do a white collar job)
- Have long, focused conversations with old people. Volunteering at a hospital and talking to my grandma have given me a deeper and more nuanced appreciation of time, health, and living, among other things.

Find a less prominent cause that you respect and believe the importance of, read up on it, donate to it (perhaps monthly), and don’t tell anyone. There are so many problems in the world that couldn’t receive enough attention.
Focus more on progress via systems rather than willpower. Make the one decision such that you don’t have to make other decisions, or at least such that you force your future self in a direction. You are what you do, not what you say you’ll do.
Figure out what motivates you or what you want to shy away from, and don’t be afraid to make bold decisions. Use this to your advantage when designing systems and environments for yourself that will guide you in the direction you want to go in, or even towards the thing you want to want.
“You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.” This is the most powerful system you should think deeply about. Who are you with, what do you talk about, how do your value systems and ideals evolve together? Don’t be afraid to make strong judgments to pattern match what you want to be more or less like. Otherwise other people are going to decide for you.

Losing someone close to you forces you to more sharply acknowledge how everything around us has a finite time, including people, objects, and experiences. This new lens irreversibly morphs your perception.

You first notice the physical world a little differently. Even though I was a reasonable follower of minimalism even before the tragedy, I found that my feelings towards material items had shrunk even more.Paying attention to life being short makes you prioritize people and experiences, and how “things” are just that, and no more.'''
