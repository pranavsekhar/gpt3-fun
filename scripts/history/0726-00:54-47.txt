Prompt:
You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams, I know I'mma do it, get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money, don't make me mention
That it'll cost you nothin' but time for you to pay attention


Generated:
What you get when you one of us, understanding?
Now all my brothers {?} {?} whatever amen
