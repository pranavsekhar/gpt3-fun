Steve Lobster but I'm not sure why his name is mentioned
Somewhere between Peter Weir and James Cameron
I predict the RIAA's like "We can't catch this motherfucker"
And screw Kanye West for making this rap music sound weird
With a bevy of MCs and DJs from Redhook to London
I can tell he condones their methods though
