Prompt:
Fuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside
I wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride
Reflecting on memories from my childhood
Bringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good
All I ever gave a fuck about was my career
But all that shit out the window now that my son is here
Fuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams
Fuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less
If it ain't 'bout my happiness, than I could give a fuck less


Generated:
Fuck today, fuck it all, fuck self calculi
Risk it all to win, fuck making it look right
Yeah, I know this shit fly, fuck being right this time
So many things this industry did not provide
Will it ever make amends?
I can think of so many songs I sold
Interludes, interviews and awkward promo shots
And so many more things that took a fuck of pride
I took a fuck of blow for all this shit
Hurt my brain, so many shows with next to nothing slashed
Booking agents acting like my shit a burden
And cult surfers with some fuckin' wish list
Or you could just be like everybody else
All I ever tried to do was write the truth
Look, hundred percent real, hundred times I stepped wrong after right

I be fucking plaques, forgetting to call my lawyer and manager
Me and Taylor [Jacobsen] been on a bunch of intense shit
People adding shit to our legacy just to diss us
And they don't even know what you doing that shit for
Dude you really buckin' then you acting like you got band in
Twenty on the list but you only sell couple of G
