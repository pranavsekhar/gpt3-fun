Prompt:
You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams, I know I'mma do it, get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money, don't make me mention
That it'll cost you nothin' but time for you to pay attention


Generated:
To the time encoded in the heartbeat 
Twice per day, that's the direct translation
That beat will hit you if you let it
Feel it hit you, feel it hit you 
Gonna feel it hit you, gonna feel it good 
          You never really got involved
       But you never cut out a brawl
       Do you even know where to start?
          You think it comes easy
       But the struggle is real
       I got mine, you got you
You gotta have faith
Like Shaq said in the movie
You gotta think whatever you think about, think about that
     I know what you're gonna say
       "What if I failed?"
Put yourself in position
     Try to get a preconceive
     "What if I can't handle failure, Joe?"
You gotta live up to it
     You see, mama ain't change
     It can't be denial
     There it is every time you see it in a way
     Someday it might be one day
     You gotta know the day is on its way
