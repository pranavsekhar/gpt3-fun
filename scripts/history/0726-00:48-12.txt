Prompt:
I've been battlin' with my demons
I'm cowardice when I see 'em
I'm powerless, I can't beat 'em
But deep down, I feel like I need 'em
Power is freedom, you can lead 'em but can't feed 'em
Smilin' on my face but I'm dyin' under the surface
What is my purpose? I'm feelin' worthless
Tell me what worth is
My flaws, I happily greet 'em
Imperfections, I love 'em
My enemies, I defeat 'em
Man, I know somebody gon' relate to this

'Til I finally got it and realized there's so much more to life

Stackin' money and readin' my son Sam I Am
Love life, can't tell you how much a fan I am

I could volunteer how many times I pulled a kilo, you can't believe half of 'em
But I won't 'cause I don't play with my respect and my bank account
That's the key to my success in the place where I am
Got family from Ghana, Africa to Haiti and SÃ£o Paolo
Yeah I'm a criminal by birth
And how I raised in the place, I had to go see
The bank line, my brain burn
I wanted that Range, but all through school
All the Porsches, I just burned a Flow, penmanship, but my report card, geez
Fuck it, it ain't shit right here, nothing to it
So at sixteen I continued to blow up like Scarface
I was running through mean streets
I was to young to be underground
I was quick to jump that fence, with bunches
