Tell me the problem, way the story is told
Whose to say a devil even exist?
But if you faced God then right now you're well with him
Everything happens for a reason and there is nothing meaningless
Like this life, I mean, are we too blind to see the divine?
Have you ever had a day where it didn't feel like anything got
